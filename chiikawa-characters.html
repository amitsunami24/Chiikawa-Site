                <h2>ちいかわ (Chiikawa)</h2>
                <img src="characters+chiikawa+phonetic+and+name+copy.jpg">
                <p>Chiikawa is gentle, sweet, and kind. Cautious to step out of their comfort zone, and somewhat shy, Chiikawa often gets nervous which usually results in anxious tears. Thankfully, best friends Hachiware and Usagi always have this cute and small creature’s back.</p>

                <h2>ハチワレ (Hachiware)</h2>
                <img src="characters+Hachiware+phonetic+and+name+copy.jpg">
                <p>Hachiware has a big heart, possesses a can-do attitude, and always finds the bright side. A true best friend, Hachiware helps Chiikawa overcome fears and makes them feel safe. Despite the cat-like ears and the occasional blep, for the record, Hachiware is not necessarily a cat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="character-card">
                <h2>うさぎ (Usagi)</h2>
                <img src="characters+USAGI+phonetic+and+name+copy.jpg">
                <p>The most energetic of the crew, Usagi seems to find the fun. Though the word usagi literally means rabbit in Japanese, and Usagi has bunny-looking ears, it’s unclear Usagi’s identity. Maybe a rabbit, maybe not. Lively and fearless, Usagi is known for signature yells “Yaha!” and “Ura!”. Interestingly, no one knows where Usagi lives.</p>

            <div class="character-card">
                <h2>モモンガ (Momonga)</h2>
                <img src="characters+momonga+phonetic+and+name+copy.jpg">
                <p>With wide expressive eyes and a big fluffy tail, Momonga is super cute and not afraid to use it. Prone to making unreasonable demands and causing trouble, the energetic Momonga often tries to wield their adorableness to get their way. Also, Momonga can fly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="character-card">
                <h2>ラッコ (Rakko)</h2>
                <img src="characters++rakko+phonetic+and+name+copy.jpg">
                <p>A highly regarded hunter, and respected for bravery, Rakko is the #1 top ranking leader in the field of monster hunting. While skilled with a sword, Rakko is generous and kind and enjoys helping Chiikawa and friends to improve their hunting abilities. Rakko also loves to indulge in sweet treats!</p>

                <h2>ポシェットのよろいさん (Pochette no-Yoroi-san)</h2>
                <img src="characters+pouchette+phonetic+and+name+copy.jpg">
                <p>Pochette no-Yoroi-san is a gentle knight who loves cute things. He enjoys crafting and sells handmade pajamas.</p>
